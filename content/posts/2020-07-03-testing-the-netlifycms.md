*How do you start your first ever post?... with a quote?*

**A lot** have changed since my last dabble into the world of blogging, coding and programming. Its been years, I guess more than 10, since I last threw myself in to any type of programming (except for the occasional excel formulas, which I don't believe count). 

Back then everything had to be build using PHP, with MySQL as the database. I created several projects - some quite successful, some which never worked as intended and some which were just god awful. The concept of a static page seemed old-fashioned back then as everything had to dynamic.

## Building this site

I started to investigate into setting up a place to unload my mind. At first I immediately went to Wordpress, this was something I knew from back then and it seemed like it could suit my needs, although a bit extensive in its functionality. There was however one thing that kept irritating me - speed. Even with the most simply WP setup I kept feeling that it was bloated, slow and to extensive in its functionalities. My need here was really not to build a comprehensive site and so it seemed like to much work to maintain a WP setup.

Imagine the shock I faced as I searched for a better solution. Everywhere I looked it wasn't dynamic webpages that was the talk of the town anymore - it was static site generators, oh and JavaScript was cool again. Everywhere, everybody was mentioning static site generators like hugo, gatsby and jekyll. 

It didn't stop here, also the concepts of the [JAMstack ](https://jamstack.org/)(Javascript, APIs and Markup), CDN (content delivery network), git ([GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.com)) was completely new concepts to me.  Oh and using the terminal for more than "ipconfig".

However it seemed like the way to go, so I threw myself into it, took a leap of faith and here we are.

This page is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (with [netlifycms ](https://www.netlifycms.org/)acting as frontend for creating and editing posts), repository and source control via [github ](https://github.com/cvewi)and served via [netlify](https://netlify.com).

I'm utterly impressed with how easy it was to get this up and running, how fast a new site is build and deployed and how well everything is support by the community.

I feel like it tingled all of my nerd genes the right places hitting the right mix between convenience- and nerd-town.

*I guess this was a start.*
